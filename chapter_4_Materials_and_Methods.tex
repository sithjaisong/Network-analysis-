\textbf{Network Comparison Measures}
For the pair of $x_{i}$ injury and $y_{i}$ variable, we denote the correlation coefficient based on Spearman's correlation coefficient by $c_{xy}^1$ and $c_{xy}^2$ in networks 1 and 2, respectively. To test whether the 2 correlation coefficients were significantly different of each network, we use Spearman's correlation coefficients, the p-values of the correlation test, the difference of the 2 correlations, the corresponding $p$-values, and the result of Fisher's z-test. First, we applied the Fisher $z$-transformation in order to stabilize variances due to sample size.

\begin{equation}
z_{xy} = \frac{1}{2} \log\left[{\frac{1 + c_{xy}}{1 - c_{xy}}}\right]
\end{equation}

if we let $z_{xy}^D $ and $z_{xy}^W$ denote the $z$- transformation for dry and wet season variable pairs, respectively. 

Here the student's t-test was utilized to identify differential co-occurrence relationships of rice injuries. For dry or wet season network, 

gene expressions from different samples were taken as replicated experiments. For a gene, whether there is a significant difference in log2 expression level from GK versus WKY can be estimated by t-test. The logarithm transformation is to make the data approximately subjected to normal distribution. To get a more powerful and less subject to bias, multiple testing was employed in this work. The threshold for adjusted p-value was set to 0.05.

Next, differences between the two correlations can be test using following. 

\begin{equation}
\triangle z_{xy} = \frac{z_{xy}^D - z_{xy}^W}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{D}-3}+ \frac{1}{N_{W}-3}}}
\end{equation}

$N_{D}$ and $N_{W}$ represent the sample size for each of season network for each country. The $Z$ has an approximately Gaussian distribution under null hypotheses that the population correlations are equal.

We consider the significantly pair-wise differential correlations ($p$vlaue < 0.05).
