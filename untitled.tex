Knowledge of the network structure of rice pest injury co-occurrence patterns helps to understand the formation and characteristics of injury profiles at different rice growing areas in South and Southeast Asia. Therefore, survey data of 420 rice fields over three years across 5 countries, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam were investigated. The aim of the study was to use network analysis to characterize the patterns of pest injury co-occurrence in specific locations and to determine the key pests using the properties of the network. The results of the weighted co-occurrence networks indicated that ???. Therefore, network analysis provides insights into the pattern of co-occurrence  which could be of particular interest for the identification of key factors with regard to different rice growing locations. .......
