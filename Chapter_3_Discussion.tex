\subsection{Discussion}

We have performed a co-occurrence network-based analysis using rice crop health survey datasets from 5 countries across South and Southeast Asia. The results from this study show that both node-level and network-level topological features are different between dry and wet season under the same location.

As the topology of the network could reflect the associations between injuries, the betweenness represents the importance of the control potential that an injury exerts over the associations of other injuries in that network. The clustering coefficients are indicative of the potential spreading of the incidence of injuries through the network. As activated injury can activate other injuries, a more densely connected network facilitates injury activation. Based on the network analysis, we will consider the network topology to guide us to design the pest management.
