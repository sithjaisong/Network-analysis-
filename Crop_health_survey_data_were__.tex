Crop health survey data were collected in 420 farmers' fields from 2010 to 2012 for wet and dry seasons in different production environments across South and South East Asia. The survey protocol as described by \citet(Savarysurvey2009), ``A survey portfolio to characterize yield-reducing factors in rice'', was used for data collection. The variables collected included patterns of cropping practices, crop growth measurement and crop management status assessments, measurements of levels of injuries caused by pests, and direct measurements of actual yields from crop cuts. This data can be classified into three groups: cropping practices, crop injuries, and actual yield measurements.
