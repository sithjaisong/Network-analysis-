Rice injuries were included the injuries caused by animal pests, diseases, and also weed infestation, which are harmful to rice plants, and importantly considered to reduce yield productivity. They were grouped in the field assessment procedure according to their mechanisms. Injuries on leaves such as bacterial leaf blight (BLB), bacterial leaf streak (BLS), leaf blast (LB), brown spot (BS) were determined as a proportion of injured leaves. Injuries on tillers or hills such as stem rot, sheath rot, sheath blight, whitehead, dead-heat were determined as a proportion of injured tillers  or panicles.  Weed infestration were determined as the percent of weed above the rice canopy (WA) and the weed below the rice canopy (WB).
