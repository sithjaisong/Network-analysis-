\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {I-1}{\ignorespaces Schematic showing principle of differential analysis. Static interaction network are measured in each of two seasons (left) resulting in interactions (black). Dry season is subtracted from wet season to create a differential interaction network (right), in which the significant differential interactions are those that positive (red) or negative (red) in score after the shift in conditions.\relax }}{5}
