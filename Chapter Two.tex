\section{Literature review}

The world's population is growing rapidly.  It reached 6 billion people in 1999 and is anticipated to reach 8.1 billion in 2025 and 9.6 billion in 2050 \citep{Alexandratos_2012_World}.  Our long-term ability to meet growing needs for food seems uncertain.  Thus, one of the greatest challenges is increasing food production in a sustainable way so that everyone can have adequate food and proper nutrition without over-exploiting the Earth's ecosystems. 

Rice is predominantly produced in Asia, so much so that thirty--one percent of the rice harvested globally comes from Southeast Asia alone \citep{OECD_2012_Agricultural}. The highest levels of productivity are found in irrigated areas, the most intensified rice production systems. Farmers can grow more than one rice crop per year here. Approximately 45 percent of the rice growing country in Southeast Asia is irrigated, with the largest irrigated areas been found in Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand \citep{Mutert_2002_Developments}. In South Asia, the two major rice-growing countries are India and Bangladesh. India has the largest rice growing area globally, about 43 million hectares, and contributes 25 percent of global rice production. Combined, rice production in South and Southeast Asia contributes around half of global rice production. If rice production in South and Southeast Asia is threatened, it will significantly affect global rice production.

Pests in rice production are significant yield reducing factors globally. \cite{Oerke_2005_Crop} estimated that weeds, animal pests, and disease caused losses around 10.2, 15.1 and 12.2 percent of global rice production, respectively. In most Asian countries, rice yields average 3-5 t/ha.  One recent survey estimated that between 120 and 200 million tons of grain are lost yearly to insects, diseases, and weeds in rice fields in tropical Asia \citep{Willocquet_2004_Research}. The mean region-wide rice yield loss due to pests was estimated at 37 percent \citep{Savary_2000_Quantification}.

In crop fields, pests or so-called biotic constraints can be defined as organisms that cause plant injuries and lead potentially to economic losses. Among the pests that attack rice are microorganisms (viruses, mycoplasmas, phytoplasmas, bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi) that can cause diseases, parasitic plants, weeds, invertebrates (insects, mollusks), and even vertebrates such as rats and birds can cause serious damages.

\subsection*{Rice Pests}

Rice fields are human-managed ecosystems, which harbor diverse communities of plant, animal, and microbial species. Many of them indeed benefit with rice plants, such as predators, parasitoids, flowering plants, and soil bacteria \citep{norton2010rice}. However, there are some species threatening the rice plant's health and can cause the quantity and quality losses. I briefly review some pests including weeds, animal pests, and diseases that are concerned the major rice production.

%Within the literature review part, I summarized major rice pests including weeds, animal pests and diseases from several scientifically reliable sources such as websites (\citet{irrirkb}), books (\citet{ouricedisease} and \citet{mew2002handbook}), and articles.

\textbf{Weeds} are plants considered as unwanted plants in the crop growing area and compete for nutrition, water, or light with cultivated crops.  Weeds are the cause of severe yield reduction problems. In Asia, they are estimated to cause yield losses up to 80 percent, depending on rice field conditions (crop establishment, water management, field management). Weeds also reduce grain quality, and increase the production costs such as labor cost and input costs \citep{litsinger1991crop}.

\textbf{Rat} causes serious yield reduction problems in many countries in Asia such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. \textit{Rattus argentiventer} is the major rat pest species in Southeast Asia.  Crop losses due to this species are typically about 10 to 20 percent. Rat damage in the rice fields is easily observed when a large number of the tillers are cut. They damage to rice plants at all stages from sowing to storage. At the seedling stage, they chop down the young seedlings and also feed on the endosperm \citep{singleton2003impacts}. 

\textbf{Golden apple snail} (\textit{Pomacea canaliculata} (Lamarck)) is an exotic species in Asia. Its origin is South America. They were introduced to farmers in countries in Asia to increase their income and as a source of protein in their diet, and also as an aquarium pet \citep{joshi2007problems}.  Now they are spreading around Asia and have become a major rice pest in the areas where they have founded. Snails attack younger seedlings at deep water levels. \citep{basilio1991problems} estimated that snail density at 8 snails/square meter could damage the rice seedlings up to 93 percent. However, seedlings become tolerant to snail attacks at the age of 40 days old \citep{sin2003damage}.  

\paragraph{Insect pests} are serious threats to rice production in nearly all regions, where rice is grown. Yield losses due to insect pests based on surveys from 11 countries were estimated at 18.5 percent \citep{pathak1994insect}.  The introduction of high yielding technology in the 1960s involving rice varieties with high tillering ability, denser plant spacing, high fertilizer application and irrigation where farmers planted two or three crops per year provided abundant habitat and food sources where the insect pests can reproduce continuously throughout the year. Moreover, the use of nitrogen fertilizers increased the insects' reproductive potential \citep{bottrell2012resurrecting}. In South and South East Asia, rice is grown in warm, humid environments conducive to the survival and proliferation of key insect pests: stem borers, rice loaders, brown planthoppers, whitebacked planthoppers and green leafhoppers.


\textbf{Stem borers} are ubiquitous throughout rice fields in Asia and cause some damage in every rice field every year. There are six species, but rice yellow stem borer, \textit{Scirpophaga incertulas} (Walker), is the most destructive species in Asia, which may cause 20 percent yield loss in early planted rice crops, and 80 percent in late-planted crops. The larvae bore into the stems and eat their way down to the base of the plant hollowing out the stem. If the damage occurred during the vegetative stage the central leafs do not unfold, turn browns and die off, this is called ``deadheart''. If this damage occurs during the reproductive stage it results in the drying of the panicles, which may not emerge or do not produce grains. This is called ``whitehead''. Yield losses from stem borer damage can reach up to 95 percent in severe infestations. \todo{Citation needed, you claim that YSB is the most destructive.}

% what it tiller mortality?
\textbf{Asian rice gall midges}, \textit{Orseolia oryzae} (Wood-Mason) damaged tillers are characterized by pale green color and the stems elongated and converted into hollow tub called ``onion leaf'' or ``silver shoot''\citep{pathak1994insect}. The Asian gall midge could cause significant yield losses of US \$ 80 million annually in India \citep{bennett2004new}. 

\textbf{Rice leaf feeders}, which include: rice leaffolder (\textit{Cnaphalocrocis medinalis}), rice whorl maggot (\textit{Hydrellia philippina} Ferinoand), rice hispa (\textit{Dicladispa viridicyanea}) (Kraatz), and  rice thrips \textit{Stenchaetothrips biformis} (Bagnall) often attack rice in the early rice stages, causing highly visible leaf injuries.\todo{citation}  Rice leaffolder larvae fold the leaves by stitching the leaf margins and feed by scraping green leaf tissue Leaves damaged by rice hispa appear irregular translucent white patches paralleling to the leaf veins. Rice leaf miner. Rice thrips are more serious pests in the dry season than wet season. It infests the rice plant during the seedling stage or two weeks after early sowing. Leaves damaged by thrips are curl and discolored. However, the injuries caused by these insect pests are not considered important as often does not translate into a yield loss because of plant compensation \citep{pathak1994insect,shepard1995rice}. \todo{Revise this para for clarity and citations for the pests.}

% revise for clarity
% what about small brown planthopper?
% I think you'd best double check whether these transmit a disease or a virus.
\textbf{Rice sucking insects}: brown planthoppers (BPH), \textit{Nilaparvata lugens} (St\aa l), small brown planthoppers (SBPH), \textit{Laodelphax striatellus} Fall \'en and whitebacked planthoppers (WBPH), \textit{Sogatella furcifera} (Horvath), and rice black bugs are sucking insects that feed on rice plants. As a result of feeding by both nymphs and adults at the base of the tillers, plants turn yellow and dry up, turn brown and die. At early stages of heavy infestation round and yellow, and brownish patches appear due to the drying up of the plants. This condition is called ``hopperburn''. It can cover large patches in rice fields. Moreover, the BPH are the vectors of \textit{Rice Ragged Stunt Virus} and \textit{Rice Grassy Stunt Virus}. The SBPH also transmits rice viral diseases such as \textit{Rice stripe virus} and \textit{Rice black-streaked dwarf virus}, The green leafhoppers, \textit{Nephotettix malayanus} and \textit{Nephotettix virescens}, can transmit rice viruses such as Rice tungro virus, Rice yellow dwarf, yellow-orange leaf, transitory yellowing \citep{ling1972rice}. Rice black bugs belong to several species, but Malaysian black bug \textit{Scotinophara coarctata} is the most common in Asia. They feed on the rice plant from seedling to maturity growth stages. Their damage can cause reddish brown or yellowing of plants. Leaves also have chlorotic lesions. Severe damage may show the symptom called ``bugburn'' showing wilting of tillers with no visible honeydew deposits or sooty molds. Plants are also stunted; and can develop stunted panicles, no panicles, incompletely excerted panicles, and unfilled spikelets or whiteheads at booting stage \citep{shepard1995rice}. \todo{Citations needed for plant hoppers and vectoring. Watch your terminology. I've already warned, you interchange the pathogen with the disease too much. Also check viral naming conventions for proper capitalization and italics.}

\textbf{Grain sucking insects} include rice bugs or slander rice bugs, and stink bug. The common species of them are \textit{Leptocorisa oratorius} F.\todo{F. what?} and \textit{Leptocorisa acuta Thunberg}. They are found commonly at the flowering to milk stages in all rice environments. They insert their needlelike mouthparts into the grains. Damaged Rice grains by these insects are characterized by deformed, spotty and empty grains. They are reported that can cause yield loss up to 30 percent. There are many rice stink bugs species reported that they damage rice grains, but the most common stink bug is \textit{Nezara viridula} (Linnaeus). They penetrate the grain hull with their strong mouthparts to feed on the endosperm \citep{shepard1995rice}. \todo{Revise this para for clarity and capitalization.}


\paragraph{Rice diseases} result in yield reductions of 10 - 15 percent in tropical Asia \citep{willocquet2004research}. Sheath blight and brown spot are important diseases in rice in Asia, each responsible for 6 percent of yield losses, whereas rice blast, bacterial leaf blight account for 1 - 3 percent and 0.1 percent of yield losses, respectively. Sheath rot, stem rot, and those known as sheath rot complex and grain discoloration are responsible for rice yield losses ranging from 0.1 - 0.5 percent, respectively. All other diseases alone or in combination do not cause more than 0.5 - 1 percent of yield losses based on estimates \citep{Savary:2000vr,mew2002handbook}. I briefly review some rice diseases that are commonly found in South and South East Asia. 

\paragraph{Foliar diseases} include brown spot, rice blast, narrow brown spot, bacterial leaf blight, bacterial leaf streak, \textit{etc}.

\textbf{Brown spot}, caused by \textit{Cochliobolus miyabeanus} (Ito \& Kuribayashi) Drechs. ex Dastur (anamorph: \textit{Bipolaris oryzae} (Breda de Haan) Shoemaker) is one of the most important disease of rice in Asia and is reported across South and South-East Asian countries. The disease appears as small oval or circular, dark brown spots on leaves or glumes. The disease is seed-transmitted and infected seed is the primary inoculum source. The disease develops quickly in fields with scarce water supply and nutritional imbalance, particularly low nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium \citep{barnwal2013review}.\todo{Yield losses?}

\textbf{Rice blast}, caused by \textit{Pyricularia grisea} Sacc., synonym \textit{P. oryzae} Cavara (teleomorph: \textit{Magnaporthe grisea} (Hebert) Barr) \citep{rossman1990pyricularia}\todo{Use teleomorph first, then anamorph as it's deprecated}, overwinters in rice straw and stubble and spreads rapidly by airborne spores. The symptoms can be found on all part of the plant including leaves, leaf collars, necks, panicles, pedicels, roots, and seeds. Leaf blast symptoms are characterized by elliptical or spindle shaped lesion with whitish-gray or greenish center and brown or purple margins with yellow halo. Neck or panicle blast, which is more damaging, appear as a dark necrotic lesion covering partially or complete around the panicle base or secondary branches. It may lead to breaking of panicles resulting in few or no grain setting. Disease is favored by high nitrogen. Soils with poor silica availability are blast conducive. Blast is highly destructive in lowland rice in temperate and subtropical Asia, and upland rice in tropical Asia, Latin America and Africa \citep{ouricedisease}.

\textbf{Narrow Brown Spot}, caused by the fungus \textit{Cercospora janseana} (Racib.) O. Const., synonym:\textit{C. oryzae} Miyake (teleomorph: \textit{Sphaerulina oryzina} K. Hara), \todo{Again, teleomorph first, then anamorph} characterized by small, narrow, elongated dark brown spots spreading uniformly over the leaf. Symptoms are usually extensive during the later stages of growth, with lesions appearing just prior to anthesis. Severe damage decreases the grain quality and reduces the milling recovery, but has no significant effect on yield losses. \todo{Citation}

\textbf{Bacterial leaf blight} or bacterial blight, caused by \textit{Xanthomonas oryzae} pv. \textit{oryzae} (Ishiyama) Swings \textit{et al.} (synonym: \textit{X. campestris} pv. \textit{oryzae} (Ishiyama) Dye is characterized by yellowing and dry leaves. The disease developed at the tips of the leaf and spread down one or both sides of the leaf and maybe through the middle leaf. The disease occurs in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. The high wind and rain were believed to aid in rapid dispersal of the pathogen. In severe epidemics, yield losses can range from 20 - 40 percent \citep{sonti1998bacterial}.

\textbf{Bacterial leaf streak}, caused by \textit{Xanthomonas oryzae} pv. \textit{oryzicola} (Ishiyama) Swings \textit{et al.} is characterized by fine translucent streak between veins. Then the streaks become yellowish-gray, the lesions coalesce, then eventually turn to brown to greyish white causing the leaves to die. This disease is common in South and South-East Asia. Severe infection results in poor grain development, broken rice and deterioration in chemical and nutritional composition. \todo{Citation}

\paragraph{Diseases on the tiller} include sheath blight and bakanae \todo{Incomplete}

\textbf{Sheath blight}, caused by \textit{Thanatephorus cucumeris} (A.B. Frank) Donk (anamorph: \textit{Rhizoctonia solani} K\"uhn) is characterized by irregular lesions usually found on the leaf sheaths (initially water-soaked to greenish gray and later becoming grayish white with a brown margin). Sclerotia (small brown-to-black, rocklike reproductive structures) may be present on the stems. Symptoms are usually observed from tillering to milk stage in a rice crop. This fungus lives in the soil and floats to the top when fields are flooded, contacts rice plants and spreads to adjacent plants. Spread of sheath blight is thus favored by dense crop canopies. It occurs throughout the rice growing areas. Sheath blight causes a yield loss of 6\% \todo{Be consistent are you spelling out or using the symbol?} across lowland rice fields in tropical Asia \cite{Savary:2006to}\todo{Why is this citation not in ()?}.

\textbf{Bakanae} or \textbf{foot rot}, caused by \textit{Gibberella fujikuroi (Sawada)} (anamorph: \textit{Fusarium moniliforme} J. Sheld) is commonly found throughout the whole rice growth stages. \todo{Common throughout all rice stages?} Infected seedlings elongate abnormally, becomes slender and the leaves turn pale yellow green. Infected plants develop roots at the upper nodes and the whole plant turns yellow. At booting stage, some infected plants die. This disease was reported that it can cause yield loss up to 20 percent in outbreak areas.\todo{Citation and revise for clarity}

\paragraph{Panicle diseases} commonly include sheath rot, dirty panicle complex or grain discoloration, and false smut.

\textbf{Sheath rot}, caused by \textit{Sarocladium oryzae} (Sawada) W. Gams \& D. Hawksworth (Synonym: \textit{Acrocylindrium oryzae} Sawada), reduces grain yield by retarding or aborting panicle emergence, and producing unfilled seeds and sterile panicles. Sheath rot also reduces grain quality by causing panicles to rot and grains to become discolored. The typical sheath rot lesion starts at the uppermost leaf sheath enclosing the young panicles. It appears oblong or as irregular spot with dark reddish, brown margins, and gray center or brownish gray throughout. \todo{Citation}

\textbf{Dirty panicle} or \textbf{grain discoloration} is characterized by darkening of glumes of spikelets, brown to black, including rotten glumes. This disease caused by multiple fungal species which include, (\textit{Alternaria alternata}, \textit{Altrernaris padwikii}, \textit{Cochilobolus miyabeanus} (synonym: \textit{Bipolaris oryzae}) \textit{Cuvularia} spp., \textit {Fusarium} spp.,\textit{Magnaporthe salvini}, \textit{M. grisea}, \textit{Nigrospora oryzae}, \textit{Sarocladium oryzae}. Affected seeds by theses pathogen have deleterious effects on the quality of seed lots, which indicate to seed health \citep{ouricedisease} and \citep{mew2002handbook}\todo{Clarify last sentence, nonsensical}.
 
\textbf{False smut} caused by \textit{Villosiclava virens} gen. nov., comb. nov. (anamorph: \textit{Ustilaginoidea virens} (Cooke) Takahashi) is characterized by the grain transformed into a mass of spore ball, which is initially orange, then become olive-green, and then greenish black at maturity \citep{tanaka2008villosiclava}. False smut of rice is reported in most rice-growing areas of the worlds. In favorable conditions, which are high humidity, and soils with high nitrogen content, yield loss caused by this disease can reach to 7 - 75 percent \citep{ouricedisease}. \todo{Nothing of mycotoxins?}

\paragraph{Viral diseases} include rice grassy stunt disease, rice ragged stunt disease, and rice tungro disease, \textit{etc}. 

\textbf{Grassy stunt disease}, caused by \textit{Rice grassy stunt virus} is transmitted by brown planthopper. Infected rice plants show stunting and proliferation of short, erect, and narrow leaves that are pale green or pale yellow. The virus reduces yields by inhibiting panicle production. Plants can be infected at all growth stages. They are most vulnerable to infection at the tillering stage. Infected stubble and volunteer rice are sources of rice grassy stunt virus. The virus cannot be transmitted via brown planthopper eggs \citep{ouricedisease,ling1972rice}.

\textbf{Rice ragged stunt disease}, caused by \textit{Rice ragged stunt virus} is transmitted by brown planthopper. Leaves of infected plants have a ragged appearance. Rice ragged stunt virus infection is particularly high in tropical conditions where rice is planted all year around and provides a continuous host for the brown plant hopper vector. Infected stubble and volunteer rice are sources of rice grassy stunt virus. The disease reduces yield by causing partially exerted panicles, unfilled grains and plant density loss. Infected crops will have significant yield losses of up to 80 percent \citep{ling1972rice}.

\textbf{Rice tungro disease}, caused by \textit{Rice tungro spherical virus} and \textit{Rice tungro bacilliform virus}, is transmitted by green leafhoppers. Tungro disease can occur during all growth stages of the rice plant. It is most frequently seen during the vegetative phase. Plants are most vulnerable at tillering stage. It causes leaf discoloration, stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains. Tungro is one of the most damaging and destructive diseases of rice in South and Southeast Asia. In severe cases, Tungro susceptible varieties infected at an early growth stage can have as high as 100 percent yield loss \citep{ouricedisease}.

Farmers encountered an estimated average of 37 percent of their yield loss because of pests and disease. This proportion will be reduced when the farmers have efficient pest management. An important concept applied in pest management is ``disease triangle''\todo{Citation}, which explains that an occurrence of plant disease epidemic need three components, virulent pest, susceptible plant and conducive environment. At the farm level, we emphasize the interactions at population level. These interactions depend on not only the physical, biological environment but also man-made activities (Fig.\ref{fig:diseasetriangle}). According to \citet{Savary:2006to}, pest management tetrahedral first discussed by \cite{Zadoks:1979ts} consists of four elements, a pest, crop, the environment and human. Human is recognized the important role in agroecosystem and should be considered to sustainable pest management \citep{Zadok1985}. Humans are not limited to farmers, but also included to farmers' communities, social networks, agro-technology suppliers, food-chain stakeholders, research and extension, and policy-makers. \todo{Revise for clarity}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The effect of cropping practice on plant pests}



Each type of pests (animal pest, weeds, pathogens) are \todo{fix this section for clarity and grammar} often coexist and reduce yields in agricultural systems. They may have interactions. In addition to the individual effects on crops, these types of pests and cropping practices can interact and impact crop production. \cite{ouricedisease,ho1994weed,cohen1998importance} and \cite{Mew:2004kh} reviewed the relationships between crop management and pest incidence. 


\subsection*{Crop establishment and pests}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Crop establishment and pests}

Crop establishment methods of rice are various, but mainly can be categorized into two types, direct seeding and transplanting. 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Weed composition in the rice field is constantly changing. Some weed species are favorably affected by production practice while some are adversely affected. Direct seeded rice more possibly encounters with weed competition than transplanted rice because they emerge simultaneously with rice seedlings and because of the absence of flooding in the early stages. Generally, weeds such as grasses, sedges, and broadleaf weeds are found in direct seeded rice fields, which dominant weeds are \textit{Echinochloa crus-galli}, and \textit{Leptochloa chinensis} among grasses, \textit{Cyperus difformis}, and \textit{Fimbristylis miliacea} among sedges, and \textit{Ammania baccifera}, \textit{Eclipta prostrata}, and \textit{Sphenoclea zeylanica} in the broadleaf category. \todo{Citation}

Compared with transplanted rice, the occurrence of insect pests and diseases is more intense in direct seeded rice because of high plant density and the consequent cooler, more humid, and shadier microclimate inside the canopy\todo{Citation}. The major insect pests of direct seeded rice are brown planthoppers, stem borers, leaffolders, and gall midges. Important diseases that affect direct seeded rice are blast, ragged stunt disease, yellow orange leaf disease, sheath blight, and dirty panicle \citep{pongprasert1995insect}. In addition to insect pests and diseases, other pests that attack emerging rice seedlings are the golden apple snail (\textit{Pomacea canaliculata}) and rats, which are more serious problems in direct seeded rice than transplanted rice.\todo{Citation}


\subsection*{Nutrient management and pest occurrence}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Nutrient management and pests}

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Nutrition management is one of the most important practices of a high production system, but nutrition management will affect the response of rice to pests, as well as development pattern of pest populations due to the change of environments\todo{Change of what environments?}. Soil fertility practices can impact the physiological susceptibility of crop plants to insect pests by either affecting the resistance of individual plant to attack or by weakening plant vulnerability to certain pests. Some studies have also documented how the shift from organic soil management to chemical fertilizers has increased the potential of certain insects and diseases to cause economic losses.\todo{Multiple citations}

Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are most often managed by the addition of fertilisers to soils. The others are most often found in sufficient quantities in most soils and no soil amendments are needed to ensure adequate supply unless soil pH limits them. However, I will briefly summarize the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium with their relationship to some of the most important rice diseases and insects.

\subsubsection{The effects of nitrogen on pest occurrence}\todo{Occurence or injury or yield losses?}

Nitrogen can prolong the vegetative period and increases the proportion of young to mature tissues in rice plants. It can also reduce the amount of cellulose in plant cell walls, predisposing plants to lodging. Aside from these, increased nitrogen was found to reduce phytoalexins in plant cells. Phytoalexins are anti-microbial compounds that build up in plants as a result of infection or stress, and are associated with resistance to fungal and bacterial diseases. On the other hand, if applied correctly, nitrogen allows better plant compensation and tolerance to injury.\todo{Citation}

Bacterial leaf blight can be aggravated by too much nitrogen, and it is even more problematic during the wet season. This is one reason why the recommendation for nitrogen fertilizer during the wet season is lower compared to the recommendation during the dry season. Other than bacterial leaf blight, excessive nitrogen can also be conducive to the development of many other diseases, such as bakanae, bacterial leaf streak, false smut, leaf blast, sheath blight, and sheath rot.\todo{Citation}

As with the impact of nitrogen on the disease, excessive nitrogen application was force more occurrence of insect pest especially stem borers, whorl maggots, brown planthoppers and leaffolders \citep{chau2003impacts,litsinger2011cultural,rashid2014effect}\todo{Revise for clarity}. The effect of nitrogen on rice insect pests are ambiguous. For example, the number of whorl maggot and rice thrips population were not develop following as the dose of nitrogen increase \citep{chau2003impacts}\todo{Revise for clarity}.

\subsubsection{The effects of phosphorous on pest occurrence}

Just as important as nitrogen, phosphorous is another essential nutrient element that promotes vigorous root development and is responsible for hardening plant tissue. Phosphorus also shortens vegetative period of the plant, as opposed to the effect of nitrogen. Proper timing in the application of phosphorus may lower the incidence of brown spot and leaf blast.\todo{Citation}

In relation to disease incidence, what we know is that phosphorus can reduce the occurrence of bacterial leaf blight and brown spot, but may promote leaf blast and sheath blight of rice. The effect of phosphorus on the population of rice insect pests was not strong \citep{chau2003impacts,rashid2014effect}, but the results of \cite{rashid2014effect} showed that increased phosphorus applicant enhanced the population of brown planthoppers.

\subsubsection{The effects of potassium on pest occurrence}

Among the three essential nutrients mentioned, potassium appeared to be the most consistent and effective in minimizing disease incidence. It was found to lower the infection rate of bacterial leaf blight, leaf blast, and brown spot, sheath blight, sheath rot, stem rot and narrow brown spot\todo{Citation}. This is because K is found to increase the concentration of inhibitory amino acids in the plants as well as phytoalexins\todo{Citation}. Potassium also hardens the plants tissues which can minimize lodging incidence and support faster recovery of injured or stressed plants\todo{Citation}. There were not many studies about the effect of potassium on the rice insect pests. \cite{rashid2014effect} showed the result in Bangladesh that high potassium application decreased population build up and dry weight of brown plant hoppers and \cite{salim2002effects} reported that reported that deficiency of potassium in rice plants increased population build up of white backed planthopper and application of high dose of potassium to rice plants decreased population build up of the insect.

\section*{Interactions between coexisting rice pests}

Mixed populations of brown planthoppers and whitebacked planthoppers were reported in many areas. \cite{naganagoud2010studies} reported the experiment multiple pest yield loss to damage function, and economic injury level Iso-loss equation by mutual regression of incidence of two pests. Leaffolder negatively related to stem borers. \cite{selvaraj2012determination} report the population of four major rice insect pests (brown planthoppers, whitebacked planthoppers, stem borers, and leaffolders) by light traps in Tungabhadra area, India from 1988 to 1990. The observations revealed that the mean populations of these pests decreased in 1989 and increased in 1990\todo{Revise para for clarity}.

Many plant diseases are caused by a particular species or even strain in diverse environments. However, there are a number of disease complexes where no one organism causes the full set of symptoms.

Akioshi\todo{check spelling} disease is known as ``hydrogen sulfide toxicity'', causes black crown and root rot, which affect the nutrient absorption. The disease is associated with abnormal soils (silica, potassium, magnesium deficiency). Plants affected by Akiochi become susceptible to \textit{Bipolaris oryzae}, the pathogen of brown spot, which is used as an index of Akiochi \citep{ouricedisease}.

The dirty panicle (grain discoloration) are complex disease caused my many fungal pathogens on the glumes, kernels or both. The fungi that are reported to be associated with discoloration of grains are \textit{Bipolaris oryzae}, \textit{Alternaria padwickii}, \textit{Pyricularia oryzae}, \textit{Fusarium moniliforme}, \textit{F. graminearum}, \textit{Nigrospora oryzae} and \textit{Curvularia} spp.\cite{ouricedisease}. However, it is still conflict such as the Pyriculris test the seed from a filed heavily infested by blast, but no \textit{P. oryzae} isolated\todo{Revise for grammar and clarity}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Survey in the field of epidemiological research}\todo{Revise for grammar}

The rice crop system is complex that the number of components is large and their interaction are complex\todo{Revise for grammar}. The dynamic of the system is encompassed by a growing crop, its physical environment, its diseases and pests, and farmers' actions, which influence the whole system. The number of rice pests (diseases, insects, and weeds) to be considered and the levels at which they vary from field to field. A rationale is often deeded to delineate the limits of the system to be addresses\todo{Revise for grammar}.

A survey is a useful tool to provide an adequate account of this diversity and deal with the several pests or variables affecting crop production, which are essential components of systems research in plant protection \citet{Zadoks:1979ts}. Field surveys generate information at the level of the population of crop stands rather than of the individual plot, field, or orchard. Such surveys raise questions regarding variation in injury and its relationships to crop management, crop environment, crop performance, and the occurrence of multiple injuries.


Application of surveys can be found in a huge diversity of research fields, including crop characteristic, cropping practices and single disease or multiple disease and insect. The pest are measurable biological variable that can be used for characterize the injuries profiled (disease and insect injuries syndrome) to stratify farmer's fields account into the characteristic of their production situations.

\cite{savary1995use} emphasized field surveys as the basic means for acquiring information and expanding knowledge to higher scales. Conversely, field surveys and the associated analytical approaches provide a framework in which to characterize disease intensities and their relationships with attributes (including crop management) of the environments where injuries occur; but they usually do not generate crop loss data \textit{per se}.

The concept of production situation described the set of factors - physical, biological, and socioeconomic - that determine agricultural production\todo{Citation}. This concept is used here within the restricted scope of an individual rice field and from the limited view point of plant protection. A quick overview of the variables listed in the following survey procedure indicates how this concept is operationalized in a survey: this list includes a few key components of rice crop management (which reflect the physical and socioeconomic environments of a crop and their interactions) and a series of rice pests (that is, insects, pathogens, and weeds).

This approach has the considerable advantage of providing quantitative estimate of the contribution of each constraint to the total yield loss. They study may be considered among the first series, where a set of pest constraints of a crop, simultaneously with environmental variables, and variables representing the current cropping practices were considered. Pests only considered some of the ``yield determining variables''. the approaches may also be considerate an attempt to incorporated the concept of production situation \textit{i.e.} the set of environment that lead to a given yield output of the system\todo{Revise for grammar}.

Methodologies used to interpret the survey data are developed for studies of the relationships for injuries - yield losses. The development of theses studied started focusing on single-disease (pest) pathosystem to more complex. The classic analytical approaches aim to assess group-wise differences, either in a univariate \textit{i.e.} parameter-by-parameter fashion or using multivariate techniques (\textit{e.g.} multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), correspondence analysis (CA), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), or principle component analysis (PCA)). Univariate methodologies are frequently used to reduce a possibly large number of measured analyses to only those that show the strongest response under the investigated conditions. Examples for such univariate approaches are significance testing methods and simple linear regression model. However, univariate methods fail to apply to different production situation or the scope that model can be applied.


Therefore, multivariate analysis methods seek to capture not only changes of a single pest. Probably the most prominent multivariate analysis techniques applied in the field of survey data are principal component analysis, cluster analysis and correspondence analysis. These analyses do not always; and to yield loss estimate\todo{Revise for clarity}. They can inform us the close relationship between changing production situations and shift crop health syndromes (changes in the dynamics of group disease or crop-limiting factors in an area)\todo{Revise for clarity}. 

Farmers' fields survey datasets are of immense value to plant pathologists; they, however, are generally heterogeneous in format (being qualitative or quantitative) and/or precision. A number of methods, some now old and seldom used, and other more recent and comparatively easier to use, are available to process this type of information. The approached used to analyst these data included three main steps: cluster analysis, multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression.


Cluster analysis represents another unsupervised multivariate technique suitable for the analysis of survey data with hierarchical cluster analysis and $k$-means clustering being the most prominent representatives. In general, clustering methods group and visualize samples according to intrinsic similarities in their measurements, irrespective of sample groupings.
