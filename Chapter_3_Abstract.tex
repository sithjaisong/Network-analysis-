\section{Using network analysis to examine animal pests and disease co-occurrence patterns in farmer's fields in irrigated lowland rice growing areas in South and South East Asia}


\subsection{abstract}
Survey data of 420 rice fields over three years across five countries, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, were analysed using network analysis. The aim of the study was to characterize the patterns of pest injury co-occurrence in specific locations and to determine the key pests in the system. The results of the weighted co-occurrence networks indicated that ???. Therefore, network analysis provides insights into the pattern of co-occurrence  which could be of particular interest for the identification of key factors with regard to different rice growing locations. .......
