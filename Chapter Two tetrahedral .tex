Farmers encountered an estimated average of 37 percent of their yield loss because of pests and disease. This proportion will be reduced when the farmers have efficient pest management. An important concept applied in pest management is ``disease triangle''\todo{Citation}, which explains that an occurrence of plant disease epidemic need three components, virulent pest, susceptible plant and conducive environment. At the farm level, we emphasize the interactions at population level. These interactions depend on not only the physical, biological environment but also man-made activities (Fig.\ref{fig:diseasetriangle}). According to \citet{Savary_2006_Quantification}, pest management tetrahedral first discussed by \cite{Zadoks_1979_Epidem} consists of four elements, a pest, crop, the environment and human. Human is recognized the important role in agroecosystem and should be considered to sustainable pest management \citep{Zadok_1985_Crop}. Humans are not limited to farmers, but also included to farmers' communities, social networks, agro-technology suppliers, food-chain stakeholders, research and extension, and policy-makers. 

Each type of pests (animal pest, weeds, pathogens) are \todo{fix this section for clarity and grammar} often coexist and reduce yields in agricultural systems. They may have interactions. In addition to the individual effects on crops, these types of pests and cropping practices can interact and impact crop production. \cite{Ou_1985_Rice,Ho_1994_Weed,Cohen_1998_Importance} and \cite{Mew_2004_Looking} reviewed the relationships between crop management and pest incidence. 
 
 The efficetive pest control management sound integrated and considerate tas the systtem  IPM strategies are filed-dependent. Among the many reasons for this is the fact that the particular combination of pest and disease t(the injury profile) that affactsa given crop is , to a signaficant extent, driven by location-specidfic crop managemnt practices. ANother reason is that the amount of yield reduction (damage) that cabn be attributeed to a given injuriy profile depend upon the attaibnale yield the crop would have achieved, had these pests been abset.
