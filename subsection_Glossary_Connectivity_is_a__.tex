\subsection{Glossary}
Connectivity is a numerical vector that reports the connectivity (also known as degree) of each node. This fundamental network concept is also known as whole network connectivity. One can also define the scaled connectivity $K = Connectivity/max(Connectivity)$ which is used for computing the hub gene significance.
