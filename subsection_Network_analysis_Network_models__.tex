\subsection*{Network analysis}

Network models were used to illustrate the co-occurrence patterns of pest injuries within same locations, where injuries represent nodes and the presence of a co-occurrence relationship based on correlation is represented by an edge using the igraph package, where each network was the union of positive or negative correlation coefficients (less than âˆ’0.25 or greater than 0.25) that were consistent within each location. 

We were also interested in generating descriptive statistics about the network that may be important for understanding co-occurrence relationships. We produced network statistics that describe the position and connectedness of injuries within each co-occurrence network. Global network properties including the density, heterogeneity, centralization were computed by using \texttt{fundamentalNetworkConcepts} function from  WGCNA package and for the basic properties such as number of nodes, edges can be computed by using functions from igraph package. Addtionally, we also calculated the small-worldness index of the network by using \texttt{smallworldness} function qgraph package. For the node-wise properties including node degree, which is the number of co-occurrence relationships that an injury is involved in a network, we used the \texttt{degree} function from igraph package. We also calculated betweenness scores for each node (injury) using the \texttt{betweenness} function from igraph package, which is defined by the number of paths through a focal microbial node. Additionally, we calculated clustering coefficients, and eigenvector using the \texttt{transitivity} function for comparison to other networks.
