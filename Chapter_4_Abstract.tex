%\section{Differential networks reveal the dynamics of animal pests and disease co-occurrences conditioned by yield levels}

%The chapter 4:-From the co-occurrence network of rice injuries in the previous chapter, I will perform statistical analysis to prove if the networks are different in different countries under same season.I will find what relationships commonly presented in different countries, what the relationships present in some countries, or especially present in a certain country.- I will use the Venn diagram to present the number of relationships that present and do not present across countries under the same season. - I will construct the co-occurrence network of rice injuries at different yield levels (low, medium, and high yield)- In networks at different yield levels, I will find what relationships commonly occur, and do not occur cross yield levels.- I will identify what relationships are not different in order to find the relationships that similarly express across yield levels, and construct a network that present the nodes with connections shared in different yield levels.- I will use a Venn diagram to present the number of nodes shared and unshared in different networks.- In the discussion, to come up with pest management development, I will link the relationships that present in the network of low, medium or high yield level to the network of each country.
