Correlation methods selected for constructing network model. The plots on the left show sample survey data taken over 29 rice injuries at 5 production environments. The next step is to compute pair-wise correlations to obtain a cross-correlation matrix (the middle plot, rows and columns represent the nodes). Then, the matrix will be used for network analysis.
