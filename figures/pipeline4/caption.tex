Schematic showing differential analysis at different yield levels. Co-occurrence networks are measured in each of two different yield levels (left) resulting in interactions (blue). The network at low yield level network is subtracted from high yield level to create a differential co-occurrence network (right), in which the significant differential interactions are those that positive in score after the shift from low to high yield state.
