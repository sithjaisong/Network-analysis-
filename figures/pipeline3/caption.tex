Schematic showing differential analysis in seasons. Co-occurrence networks are measured in each of two seasons (left) resulting in interactions (black). Dry season is subtracted from wet season to create a differential co-occurrence network (right), in which the significant differential interactions are those that positive (red) or negative (blue) in score after the shift in conditions, which means differential in dry, and wet season, respectively.
