Co-occurrence network of injury variables observed in different countries and different seasons. Nodes present the injury variables. Edges represent positive (blue) and negative (red) associations. The thickness of edges represent the level of association. the layout of these networks are based on the Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm, which places closely connected nodes near each other. Cluster structure of the network detected by the Wlaktrap algorithm. Nodes that do not have the same color are not in the same cluster.
