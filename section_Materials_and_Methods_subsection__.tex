\subsection*{Study sites, sampling and data collection}
We conducted the surveys located in the South and South East Asia, Kerala, India(Lat , Long), Indonesia (Lat , Long), Philippines (Lat , Long), Central Plain, Thailand (Lat , Long), and Mekong Delta, Vietnam (Lat , Long). Theses are the important rice growing areas, where use irrigated lowland rice ecosystem, intensive condition, which grow twice per year. We sampled in , under same standardized protocol described in the IRRI publication, ``A survey portfolio to characterize yield-reducing factors in rice'', was used for data collection \cite{Savarysurvey2009}.
