\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Study sites, sampling and data collection}
We used data from surveys conducted in Kerala, India; West Java Indonesia; Laguna, Philippines; Central Plain, Thailand;, and Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These are major irrigated lowland rice growing areas where where rice is intensively cropped growing rice at least two seasons per year per year. We sampled in , under same standardized protocol described in the IRRI publication, ``A survey portfolio to characterize yield-reducing factors in rice'', was used for data collection \cite{Savarysurvey2009}.
