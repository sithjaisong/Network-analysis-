\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Study sites, sampling and data collection}
We used data from surveys conducted in Tamil Nadu  and Kerala, India; West Java, Indonesia; Laguna, Philippines; Central Plain, Thailand; and Mekong river delta, Vietnam for consecutives (2009 - 2013). These are major irrigated lowland rice growing areas where where rice is intensively cropped growing rice at least two seasons per year per year. The survey procedure and data were based on a standardized protocol described  in, ``A survey portfolio to characterize yield-reducing factors in rice'' developed by \citet{Savarysurvey2009}.
