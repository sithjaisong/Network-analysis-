\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Study sites, sampling and data collection}
We used data from surveys conducted in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, India; West Java, Indonesia; Laguna, Philippines; Central Plain, Thailand; and Mekong river delta, Vietnam. These are major irrigated lowland rice growing areas where where rice is intensively cropped growing rice at least two seasons per year per year. Four-hundred twenty farmers' fields were sampled using a standardized protocol described in the IRRI publication, ``A survey portfolio to characterize yield-reducing factors in rice'', was used for data collection \cite{Savarysurvey2009}.
